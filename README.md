grocery
=======
This is my playground application. I am using it to create a modern scalable app using all kind of new technology and tools.

v1
===
Core app grocery list present, rest api (routes) only present

v1.1
===
Using a parent pom to share the dependencies. The projects are not build from the parent because I want to force the separation of the modules.
